Mass spring simulation on a disk

Used to show the difference between division allowing 4-way junctions or not. (in collaboration with Sampathkumar)

Changing how fast new walls age and stiffen, changes the average angle, for example .1 vs 3 (3 ~ 2 cell cycles?)
22ch to data:
Area 45 / MinDis 2.0 / Center Noise 2.0 and then with Wall Noise either equally distributed 2.0 or Gaussian 0.5
